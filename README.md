Code for our paper titled 

"Generative AI based Augmentation for Offshore Jacket Design: An Integrated Approach for Mixed Tabular Data Generation under Data Scarcity and Imbalance"

---

The dataset of the 100 real jacket substructure designs described in our paper can be found under [real_structures.json](real_structures.json)


---

To compute all objectives for a given population, run [evaluate_designs.ipynb](Genetic_Algorithm/util/evaluate_designs.ipynb), placing the .json file of the population under [Genetic_Algorithm/util/data/to_evaluate](Genetic_Algorithm/util/data/to_evaluate).

*Figure 6: Graphical representation of the plausibility objective and threshold calculation
for a one-class SVM. (a) depicts the learned hyperplane of the SVM. (b) shows the
distribution of the signed distances of the real data points to the hyperplane, and the
chosen threshold. (c) represents an example Pareto-optimal set of GA-generated solutions
constrained by a threshold.*
